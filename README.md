# tensorflow-in-Colab
It is too troublesome to configure tensorflow through conda on macOS. After many trials, I decided to give up the local environment and turned to Google's colab
## ATTENTION: 
Only a copy is saved in github. If you need to modify it, you need to go back to colab to make modifications, and back up the copy to github again.
